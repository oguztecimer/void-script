# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Editor-first milestone — players spend 90% of time in the editor; foundation must land before any visual comparison
- Init: CSS Modules + tokens.css approach confirmed; no CSS-in-JS (zero runtime cost critical for keystroke re-renders)
- Init: Fontsource npm packages chosen over CDN fonts to avoid wry custom protocol CORS surface

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: wry custom protocol CORS headers for font MIME types need empirical verification on a clean macOS account before Phase 1 is marked complete
- Phase 4: CodeMirror 6 EditorState map pattern with Zustand needs careful design — see discuss.codemirror.net "Preserving state when switching between files"
- Phase 8: Breakpoint overlay gutter requires a custom GutterMarker implementation; no off-the-shelf solution exists
- Phase 9: VoidScript parser syntax node type names are not documented; need to read parser source before breadcrumb implementation
